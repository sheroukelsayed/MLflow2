# MLflow Experiment Tracking with Logistic Regression

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to use **MLflow** to track machine learning experiments. It uses the **Iris dataset** and a **Logistic Regression model** to showcase how to log parameters, metrics, and models using **MLflow**. The project is managed within **Visual Studio Code** and tracked via MLflow's UI.
